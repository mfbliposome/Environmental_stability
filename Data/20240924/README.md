This batch of data is to investigate the affect for vesicles formation in different environments that have different pH.  
There are total 6 samples and total 16 environments:  
1M HCL, 60uL + water  
1M HCL, 30uL + water  
0.1M NaOH 15uL + water  
0.1M NaOH 30uL + water  
1M HCL, 60uL + seasalt  
1M HCL, 30uL + seasalt  
0.1M NaOH 15uL + seasalt  
0.1M NaOH 30uL + seasalt  
1M HCL, 60uL + Seasalt +soup  
1M HCL, 30uL + Seasalt +soup  
0.1M NaOH 15uL + Seasalt +soup  
0.1M NaOH 30uL + Seasalt +soup  
Nacl 10mM  
Nacl 50mM  
Nacl 200mM  
Nacl 500mM  

Each sample has done duplicates.

This batch of experiments will be reconducted.
