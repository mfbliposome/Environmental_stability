The batch of data is hydrated with Water (first A1 through D12) and NaCl (E1 through H12)

A randomized (but diverse) sample of amphiphile compositions as we change salinity and pH. Used our existing model (AL campaing) to find maximum concentrations that give us about 50% vesicles/no vesicles and are compositionally sampled diversely in that space.
