The batch of data is hydrated with Water (plate 1) and NaCl (plate 2)

A randomized (but diverse) sample of amphiphile compositions as we change salinity and pH. Used our existing model (AL campaing) to find maximum concentrations that give us about 50% vesicles/no vesicles and are compositionally sampled diversely in that space.

Probability of forming vesicles increases from sample 1 (low probability) to sample 48 (high probability). Samples are in duplicate.
