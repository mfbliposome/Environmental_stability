The batch of data is hydrated with Water (plate 1) and NaCl (plate 2)

A randomized (but diverse) sample of amphiphile compositions as we change salinity and pH. Used our existing model (AL campaing) to find maximum concentrations that give us about 50% vesicles/no vesicles and are compositionally sampled diversely in that space.

Samples 1-24 and 49-72 are high probability formers and samples 25-48 and 73-96 are low probability formers.
