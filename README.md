# Repository Structure and Data Description
This repository contains experimental data generated during the study of vesicle formation under varied environmental conditions. While multiple datasets are included for transparency and reproducibility, only the datasets contained in the folders 20241206_ES and 20250307 are used in the analysis and results presented in the manuscript.
## Overview of Folders
This repo has 2 subfolders: 'data', 'soup':
- 'data' contains all experimental datasets generated throughout the project.
- 'soup' contains supplementary information related to the preparation and characterization of prebiotic soup solutions. 
## Supporting and Exploratory Datasets ('data')
The majority of subfolders within 'data'correspond to exploratory experiments, optimization steps, controls, and replicates conducted during method development. These datasets are provided for completeness but are not included in the quantitative analysis of the paper.
### Data Used in the Manuscript
‘20241206_ES’ (Manuscript dataset I)
This folder contains vesicle count data for the top 8 samples (top_8_samples_GSx_20241106.csv) rehydrated in 12 environmental conditions and the Vesicle counts: df_final_ES_20241206.csv
This dataset establishes baseline vesicle formation behavior using decyl sodium sulfate (DS) across environments and serves as a reference for subsequent surfactant substitution experiments.
‘20250307’ (Manuscript dataset II)
This folder contains all final experimental data analyzed and discussed in the manuscript.
- Sample set: top_8_samples_GSx_20241106.csv, rehydrated in 12 environmental conditions.
- Surfactant substitution experiments: Replacement of decyl sodium sulfate (DS) with dodecyl sodium sulfate (DDS), Vesicle counts: df_final_sulfate_20250307.csv. Replacement of dodecyl sodium sulfate (DDS) with dodecyl sodium phosphate (DDP), Vesicle counts: df_final_phosphate_20250307.csv
- Additional physicochemical measurements:
Critical Vesicle Concentration (CVC) data for DS, DDS, and DDP: CVC_data.zip, pH measurements for DS, DDS, and DDP solutions: ph_DS_DDS_DDP.xlsx

## 'soup'
This folder contain the Meteoric Soup Recipe used in the experiments.
