# Environmental_stability
Environmental Stability of Alkyl Phosphate and Sulfate-Containing Membranes as Early Cell Models
## Folder structure
In this repo, it has 2 subfolders: 'data', 'soup'.
### folder 'data'
In this folder, it has stored the data files for each experiments  including:
- folder '20240815': Original batch of samples rehydrate with Water and NaCl 'original_scale_df_ES_20240730.csv',  vesicles count in 'df_final_20240817.csv'
- folder '20240823': Same batch of samples as previous rehydrate with Citrate solution and Bicene solution, vesicles count in  'df_final_20240823.csv'
- folder '20240830': Same batch of samples as original rehydrate with Soup solution and Magnesium chloride, vesicles count in  'df_final_20240830.csv'
- folder '20240914': This data set is invalid because  monocaprylin was used instead of monocaprin.
- folder '20240924': 6 samples from the original batch of samples rehydrate in 16 environments  '2024.09.26_hydrate-env_stability.xlsx', vesicles count in 'df_final_20240924.csv'
- folders '20240927', '20240927-1', '20240927-2': Same experiment as '20240924'
- folder '20241111': 'top_12_samples_GSx_20241106.csv' rehydate in 16 environments, vesicles count in'df_final_20241111.csv ', pH values recoded in 'enviph.xlsx'
- folder '20241206_ES': 'top_8_samples_GSx_20241106.csv' rehydrate in 12 environments,  vesicles count in  'df_final_ES_20241206.csv '
- folder '20250307'(data presented for publication): 'top_8_samples_GSx_20241106.csv' rehydrate in 12 environments, replacing decyl soduim sulfate (DS) with dodecyl soduim sulfate (DDS), vesicles count in 'df_final_sulfate_20250307.'. replacing dodecyl soduim sulfate (DDS) with dodecyl soduim phosphate (DDP), vesicles count in 'df_final_phosphate_20250307.csv'. Critical Vesicle Concentration data  of DS/DDS/DDP recorded in 'CVC_data.zip', pH values of DS/DDS/DDP recorded in 'ph_DS_DDS_DDP.xlsx'.
#### folder 'soup':
- This folder contain the Meteoric Soup Recipe.
